# ezraknet
RakNet made simple with simple CMake support.

## Why?
Because RakNet has tons of files in it's repo, and it's pretty boring having to search and build the specific stuff you need. 

Here instead we have an straightforward generation. No samples, no shit. Just what you need.

## How?
### Linux && MSYS2
```
git clone https://github.com/PerikiyoXD/ezraknet
cd ezraknet
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Windows
```
git clone https://github.com/PerikiyoXD/ezraknet
cd ezraknet
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Open Visual Studio Solution (.sln) located inside ``build`` folder. (ie: C:/location/to/your/ezraknet/build/ezraknet.sln)
